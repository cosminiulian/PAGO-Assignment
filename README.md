# PAGO-Assignment

This exercise aims to create an iOS application written in Swift using UIKit that consumes an API endpoint that retrieves a list of contacts, caches it, and displays it. When clicking on a contact, or on the add new contact button, we should navigate to another screen that will show the contactâ€™s information such as first name, last name, phone number, and email address.
